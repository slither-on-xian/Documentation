## üîÑ Step 1: Swap SOL for $XIAN on Raydium

1. **Connect Your Wallet**  
   - If you don't have one, install a Solana wallet like [Phantom](https://phantom.app/) which is preferred for bridging.
   - Procure SOL through your preferred means.
   - Go to [Raydium Swap](https://raydium.io/swap/?inputMint=sol&outputMint=GnaXkbmMV1zGK6bRCQnM9Jd6Jv2Hjw5b2PFVBaKEE5At). This link takes you to the direct swap page for the token GnaXkbmMV1zGK6bRCQnM9Jd6Jv2Hjw5b2PFVBaKEE5At which is the wrapped $XIAN token on Solana.
   - Click **I understand, confirm** for the $XIAN trading pair.

  <img src="pictures/swap_ex1.png" alt="SNAKexchange example swap" />
</p>

     - Decrease the swap amount until the **price impact** is <3%.
     - OR Click the small gear above the swap interface, and change the slippage max to something larger than the calculated price impact and then click **Close**.
