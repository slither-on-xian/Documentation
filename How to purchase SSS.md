## üîÑ Step 1: Swap SOL for $XIAN on Raydium

   - Go to [Raydium Swap](https://raydium.io/swap/?inputMint=sol&outputMint=GnaXkbmMV1zGK6bRCQnM9Jd6Jv2Hjw5b2PFVBaKEE5At). This link takes you to the direct swap page for the token GnaXkbmMV1zGK6bRCQnM9Jd6Jv2Hjw5b2PFVBaKEE5At which is the wrapped $XIAN token on Solana.
